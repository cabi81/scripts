Simple script that installs additional useful programs to a Debian Netinstall installation.
Once the netinstall has been installed, this would be Phase 2 installation.

Steps:
1. Download the postinstall.sh
2. chmod +x postinstall.sh
3. sudo ./postinstall.sh
4. Prey it installs everything :)

It was not meant to be complicated. Download, run and wait.
